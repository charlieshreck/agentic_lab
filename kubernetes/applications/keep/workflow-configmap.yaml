  # configured in Keep's database. This configmap is kept for documentation
  # but the workflow is disabled to avoid duplicate/conflicting requests.

  # The webhook provider sends alerts to: http://langgraph.ai-platform.svc.cluster.local:8000/keep-alert
  # LangGraph processes them and notifies Afferent PWA for mobile alert triage.
