  # NOTE: Seed/init Jobs are NOT included here.
  # They were removed to prevent ArgoCD recreation loops.
  # Jobs are immutable - ArgoCD can't update them, so it deletes/recreates every sync.
  # The seed data is already in Qdrant. To re-seed, run manually:
  #   kubectl apply -f init-collections-job.yaml
  #   kubectl apply -f device-types-seed.yaml
